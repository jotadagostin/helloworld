            Hey how's it going? I'm a Front-end instructor at Alura and I'm happy to see you here.

            My history with programming began at the Federal Institute of Piauí (IFPI), when I attended high school integrated with the Computer Science course. I learned programming logic and the basics of several languages, such as PHP, Python, Java, but without going too deep into each one of them. I really enjoyed studying programming, but at the time I had no idea that I would work with it today.
        </p>
        <p className="styles.paragraph">
            In higher education, I chose to study Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI). There I managed to enter the PET (Tutorial Education Program), an academic group that contributes in various ways to the course. There I had the opportunity to study web development to be one of their website maintainers.
        </p>
        <p className="styles.paragraph">
            With that I had my dev experience closer to reality, with implementation deadlines for the website, and I learned a lot while coding.
        </p>
        <p className="styles.paragraph">
            And it was while I was at PET that I decided to look for an internship in web development. I found a job at Alura for the Scuba Team and realized that it combined two passions of mine: programming and education. To my happiness, I was chosen to be part of the team.
        </p>
        <p className="styles.paragraph">
            Since then, it's been just learning after learning. Alura is a school not only for its students, but also for its employees. Today I am very happy to have the opportunity to bring this rich and charming content to you. Hope you learn a lot!
